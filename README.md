## Try it

https://my-json-server.typicode.com/wojtek1150/test-db

## Available Methods

You can use GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE. Changes aren't persisted between calls.

## Limits

To be able to provide a free service to as many people as possible during this phase, the project comes with a few limits:

* Changes are faked and aren't persisted (just like JSONPlaceholder)
* Requests are cached (1 minute)
* db.json has limits
* All servers are public
* Private GitHub repositories aren't supported (yet)
